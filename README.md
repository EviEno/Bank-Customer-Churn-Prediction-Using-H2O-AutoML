# Bank Customer Churn Prediction Using H2O AutoML

The main aim of this project is to predict whether a person will leave the bank service i.e. he/she will churn or not using Machine learning and Auto Machine Learning Techniques.


### What is Churn?
In general, Churn is expressed as a degree of customer inactivity or disengagement, observed over a given time. This manifest within the data in various forms such as the recency of account actions or change in the account balance.

### The Aim of the Project
We aim to accomplish the following for this project:
- identify and visualize which factors contribute to customer churn
- Build a prediction model that will perform the following:
  
1. Classify if a customer is going or not

2. Preferably and based on model performance, choose a model that will attach a probability to the churn to make it easier for customer service to target low-hanging fruits in their effort to prevent churn

### TimeLine of the project
- Data Analysis
- Feature Engineering
- Model Building using Machine learning
- Model Building using Auto Machine learning
